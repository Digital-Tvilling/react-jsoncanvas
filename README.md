A React library for rendering JSON Canvas. For more information about
JSON Canvas, visit [jsoncanvas.org](https://jsoncanvas.org).

## Current state/todo/needed
Provide a [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) environment with a proper package.json to run this example in.

For now se imports in index.tsx to see the dependencies. Other dependencies being used is [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com).

React for rendering components, Tailwindcss for styling and [https://d3js.org](D3) for handling zoom and drag/drop in canvas functionality is core in this implementation, and for now react-markdown is being used to render html from markdown.

We aim to minimize use of external css files to keep React components as [https://www.epicweb.dev/full-stack-components](composable) as possible.

A lot of functionality and logic is taken from the [jsoncanvas](https://github.com/obsidianmd/jsoncanvas) repository and if needed will be refactored to align more with react standards.
